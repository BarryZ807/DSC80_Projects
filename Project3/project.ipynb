    "* **For the checkpoint, you only need to turn in a `project.py` containing solutions for questions 1-4**\n",
    "    - The checkpoint autograder on Gradescope does not thoroughly check your code -- it only runs the doctests on problems 1-4 to make sure that you have completed them. When you submit the final version of the project, we will use more tests to check these answers more thoroughly.\n",

    "* Run your functions on the main dataset (`grades`) and ask yourself if the output *looks correct.*\n",

    "1. These questions intentionally build off of each other and the final result matters! In fact, you can 'get a question correct', but only receive partial credit on it because a previous answer was wrong.\n",
    "    - Credit for a question will typically receive partial credit based on *how close* your answer is to correct (as well as some credit for a solution in the correct form). \n",
    "    - You should try to assess your answer to each question based on what you understand of the data. This might involve writing extensive code (that isn't turned in) just to check your work! Suggestions on checking your work are given in the assignment, but you should also think of your own ways of checking your work.\n",
    "    - As you do this project, think about the data from the perspective of the student (which should be easy to do!)"
